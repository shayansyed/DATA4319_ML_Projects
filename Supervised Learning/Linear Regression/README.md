# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

Linear Regression is of two types: Simple and Multiple. Simple Linear Regression is where only one independent variable is present and the model has to find the linear relationship of it with the dependent variable

Whereas, In Multiple Linear Regression there are more than one independent variables for the model to find the relationship.

In tihs project, we will be using simple linear regression.
