# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

The Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm.

It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model.

It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label. This is achieved by calculating the weighted sum of the inputs and a bias (set to 1). The weighted sum of the input of the model is called the activation.
